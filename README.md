# Countries app

The purpose of this repository is to practice React and Redux to build a countries app. The app uses the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) to display a list of countries, [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) for weather details and [Google Maps Embed API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-started) for maps. This app is built with React and uses Redux and Redux Toolkit for state management.
